# Gaming News Site





## Problem Statement
This project aims to build a news website for the Indian gaming community. In the past few
years gaming as a whole has had a huge boost on all platforms and due to the recent pandemic,
it has got an even bigger boost. Making it a million dollar industry. To keep these gamers up
to date there is no such specific website. So we decided to create a website dedicated to Indian
gaming community.
